             <h2> cry for me </h2>
             <p> This could be recency bias but its one of my favorite music videos from him
             of his recent videos. This music video isnt a generic one of him just singing and dancing but its more artistitic a bit confusing but it stands out and its just nice to look at. </p>

             <h3> song explanation </h3>
             <p> The song for me is the best in his new album it has a somewhat complex lyrics somewhat like a breakup song. I think
             its relatable for most people that have been in love before and have had that relationship end. It is a very vulnerable song
             about crying for that person, and how you thought it could be the one. A kind of selfish thought too with wanting that person 
             to also cry for you since that feels like you two are now even. </p>
             
             <p> It manages to have what could be a sad song with a very good and catchy beat. For me personally first time I heard it I was like should I be sad or should I feel hyped up, 
             because the beat is just so good. Especially the chorus toward the end makes me lock in when I have to finish homework faster. </p>
              <h3> video explanation </h3>
             <p> The video feels cinematic its in black and white and blends live action and also feels like watching something animated or paintings moving.
             It feels like the end credit of a movie, very artistic. there is like time lapse of things going on and it is visually stunning. It also takes the cry for me
             concept and adds the models crying in dramatic way toward the end. The music video seems to be taking place inside of his head and its how he feels and the thoughts he is having. </p>

             <h2>out of time </h2>
             <p> this music video is a bit more to what is expected of one it tells a story through the video. </p>

             <h3> song explanation </h3>
             <p>This song is another tragic song about love. About being to late and running out of time with someone he was interested in and loved. It is more chill song a bit slower than cry for me. 
             but it is nice and relaxing a good song to hear while going for a night drive. It is mostly a song about reflection and remembering the good times before he lost her. Very good instrumental to in the
             background while having catchy lyrics. </p>
             
              <h3> video explanation </h3>
             <p> First I want to say that I was shocked that Jung Ho-Yeon she was the actress in squid games so that was nice surprise. The video seems to be a story of how he met her and how they fell for each other.
             It shows the honeymoon phase that they had through flashback scenes. It is like a feel good video if you see the video you think is a love song but that adds to the tragic lyrics that is now in the past. 
             It seems that is the entire video but it is deeper than that as the end it gets eery.It ends up feeling like horror movie with the music distortion. Then you see some blood and a messed up face, and you see 
             he is in what seems to be a hospital and they put a mask on him and jim carrey the doctor and is narrating to him when he wakes up.</p>

             <h2> snowchild </h2>
             <p> Is and animated music video so it is different as not a lot of music videos are animated. It is nicely animated and tells a whole story from his musical journey. </p>

              <h3> song explanation </h3>
             <p> He is singing about his life story how he became a singer and how he was currently living back then. He sings about his life experiences and tells his story. 
             It sounds like an introspective song, where you can reflect. It has nice beat a bit calming, a good song to play when you feel neutral.This song is just a vibe and a mood.  </p>
              <h3> video explanation </h3>
             <p> This song is a tribute to his fans as it highlights the era of all his past albums starts with trilogy shows the house of balloons. his classic jacket and his haircut back then, the color was grey as that album also had those colors.
             Then shows the city and its blue pink and green so shows kissland era. Then he goes to elevator and he shows up in hollywood and its the beauty behind the madness era then shows 2 women turning into panthers and it is the starboy era. It does 
             like anime style artstyle, as he then fights both panthers with with crosses. Then bats take him taking him to the "my dear melancholy" era and lastly wears his classic red suit as he is in the present in the desert in the "after hours" era. 
             This music video is like a movie of his life and references all animated with nice artstyle and visually appealing in this journey. </p>
